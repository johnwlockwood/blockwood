Wednesday, I attended the 40th year [celebration](http://www.cac.ca.gov/news/prdetail.php?id=216) of the [California Arts Council](http://www.cac.ca.gov/),
and it changed me. I gained a deeper understanding of people working together 
with diverse creativity to achieve a higher state. I got perspective of the
the people who started it successfully and saw part of its beautiful fruition. 
Governor Jerry Brown has quite the history, he started the Arts Council in 1976 
as Governor and now, 40 years later, was there to celebrate it. Brown is highly
skilled at politics, understanding fundementals to transend the idea of
politics as self-serving means to gain power, and to hate on people and ideas
that are different, but to creatively bring people
to take action that improves everyone's lives. He guided early council members
to fight for not just what they wanted, but to find ways that integrated
what they wanted to what other people were working toward. To understand 
how they were mutually benefitial. Understand and promote how to augment means 
to a better end, and more people will work to achieve it. It is the 
essence of creativity which the arts develop.

My eyes flooded with tears at the performances. My mind was blown at the
fluid mixture of culture. How could these things mix together with such
crispness and beauty? I was looking at a Jackson Pollack painting come to life.
The words from actors, poets, musicians and politicians. The music and dance 
from cultures around the world. The [AXIS Dance Company](http://www.axisdance.org/)
duo of one man in a wheel chair and a woman pulled off a powerful emotional 
performance.
Great Wall Youth Orchestra played their, traditional, thousands of years old
instruments, following one of the players talking about how the group and the
arts have improved her life. The movement and color of mexican [Ballet Folkl√≥rico de Sacramento](http://imbasac.com/) was especially moving.
The African American modern dance company, [Lula Washington Dance](http://www.lulawashington.org/) is exuberance in the 
form of dance. Their bodies so well trained, they have put in amazing practice
and dedication to their craft. [Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir](http://www.oigc.org/)
demonstrated the power of harmonics. [San Jose Taiko](https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/roy-and-pj-hirabayashi) have
created something that you have to witness to believe. Some how fusing Japanese
drumming with culture from American and around the world.

What do the arts give you? How can development of creativity by our fellows
help you and your loved ones?  How can your own recognition and integration 
with other people's creativity improve your life? Life is full of problems
and desires. There are things we want to have, to experience, to enjoy. The
products of creatvity and thoughtful refinement. All these things take not 
just hard work, but work that is effective toward some goal. The more people
who can creativly combine skills and action to achieve great and delightful
things hitherto unseen. The better life will get.
