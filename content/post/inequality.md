Inequality. Inequality is what brings us together today. Let's examine the 
pressures of inequality and perhaps pressures that could affect it. 

The conservative and moreso the libratarian views on financial inequality is
laissez faire. The market will behave and make everyone happier, and create
the most growth. Captial will be allocated most efficiently by a free market.
Those bastards didn't know about high-frequency traders and 
credit default swaps. They didn't know about "Too Big to Fail."

Sure, follow many problems back through layers of legislation, each one
trying to solve problems back to the previous ones, but there was a 
real-life problem that people tried to solve.

In anycase, there is a huge matrix of consequences of human action that
me must recognize and deal with. We don't start out in a vacuum, we are
living in the world created by the people around us and their past. We
shouldn't waste cycles trying to force extreme moves, that's not to say
things can't change rapidly, but it seems to usually be not good. 
Look at China's Great Leap Forward where millions died, and this wasn't
some death squads or genocidal mobs, but they tried to 
force everyone to farm the same way all over the country and people starved
because things don't grow the same in different conditions and they 
weren't allowed to adapt.

Hong Kong seems to be doing very well and that has had a very laissez-faire
market policy place for decades.

Progressive income tax should put a downward pressure on inequality. It
would incentize a company to invest more evenly to it's employees because
it would reduce the amount of revenue going to taxes. Improving employees
quality of life and productivity. Spending on training and improving will
make employees more productive, improving bottom lines and revenue.
They would justify their increase in income and help enrich more people.

We know that technique and technology can multiply a person's performance.
How do we not continually invest into people to advance them? Do we let
everyone stagnate and scrape a much profit off as soon it is available?

People will make many small decisions and they will be bias in some way.
They will come up with ideas about how they can put different people
together until they go together like peanut butter and chocolate and 
more optimally work toward the company goals, those people will shine
and be worth a pay increase.

Say wealth was hyper concentrated and this allowed the person to make the
most money to have a very outsized influence on the society.
Would those few people be the able to most efficiently allocate
all that capital and be trusted not to destroy it?

Give captial to someone with no experience with capital and they seem to often
destroy it.
